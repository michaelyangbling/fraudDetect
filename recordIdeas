PCA to reduce dimension, since feature is sparse due to too many categories in a categorical feature, when using dummy encoding
Auc cost function or weighted training to deal with imbalanced classes
time can be split into time windows to be categorical, or just use continuous time
wide and deep NN may need detailed tuning

hash categories may help:
As with many counterintuitive phenomena in machine learning, 
it turns out that hashing often works well in practice. 
That's because hash categories provide the model with some separation.

Neural Network
When using sample training to do CV (100000 records)
CV result:
128 batch size( about 0.994 auc ) performs better than 1000( about 0.991 auc) batch size. 
when using 128 batch size, best CV score until auc decline in validation set ( manual early stopping )

每次mini batch 取128个，几分钟随便跑了跑三万轮gradient descent，6万个test data CV出来0.996的auc。。。不知道为啥做CV准确率这么高，
